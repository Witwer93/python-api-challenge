# python-api-challenge
 
This assignment asked that we work with apis to pull weather data for a random set of cities around the world, and use that
data to look for an ideal place to take a vacation.

We used the openweathermap api and the gmaps api.

The biggest challenge of this assignment was constructing the for loops to iterate through larger dataframes collecting specific values.
We also had to work with a gmaps heatmap, which was a little challenging.
Here is the heatmap I produced:
